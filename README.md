# callflux
# Note  : -

This app has been created for testing purposes only.
You can add a user to this app who has signed in with their mobile number.
If you want to make a video call, there's a menu called Calling. After clicking on it, the user you added will appear. When you call a user, the call will only go through if the user is at home; otherwise, it won't.
You can also update the app profile |
